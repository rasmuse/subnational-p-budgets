## How to use this code repository

The `.ipynb` files (`Crop production.ipynb`, etc) are Jupyter notebooks to run all the major parts of the calculations. These can be inspected online by clicking the links.

* [Permanent grassland yields](Permanent%20grassland%20yields.ipynb)
* [Manure](Manure.ipynb)
* [Mineral fertilizer](Mineral%20fertilizer.ipynb)
* [Crop production](Crop%20production.ipynb)
* [P budgets](P%20budgets.ipynb)
* [Results and figures](Results%20and%20figures.ipynb)

A zip file with the main results is submitted along with the paper and will thus available that way.

The repository can also be cloned and run on your own computer. I have taken reasonable steps to keep the code portable, but please note it has only been tested on one computer running Ubuntu 18.04. Your mileage may vary.

Most of the necessary indata is available on request from the corresponding author (Rasmus Einarsson). The environmental zones data by Metzger et al. (2005) are available on request from Dr. Metzger.
